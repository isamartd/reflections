What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros ->
    	you decide what versions can be commited, so there will versions you decide
    	not to save
    Cons ->
    	if an unexpeted error happens is more easy recovery data

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    multiple files in once you can save complete funcinality and recover it easier
    each file separately you hace more control
